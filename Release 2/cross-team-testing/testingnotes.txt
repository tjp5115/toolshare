zipCode does not return an error in the form when registering with an invalid zipCode.
invalid zipCodes lengths are still being added to the database. it was noticed that
a max length is described in the model, but it doesnt appear that django is recognizing 
that. CharField in model vs. IntField in form. The max length validation may not be fully
compatible since there is a difference in type.

Capitalize tool name when displaying in table ( .capitalize)

tool added with invalid field! added again when the validator passes

Login banner does not display correctly in Firefox Canonical release (v25)

cancelling registration causes a form resubmission dialogue box from the browser to pop up

change the banner for  each app index?

consider use of modals or tooltips to aid in usability?

It seems that the user cannot update their profile information. Is this
something that could be caused by running on Django 1.5.2?

displaying shed information just duplicates what is in the sharezone table.
do these ever get out of sync?

where are site stats?
